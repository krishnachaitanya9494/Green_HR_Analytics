## Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition data to identify key patterns affecting workforce retention. It combines Python-based exploratory data analysis with an interactive Tableau dashboard to deliver clear, actionable HR insights.

The objective is to understand where attrition occurs, which employee groups are most impacted, and how factors such as age, salary, education, department, and job role influence attrition.
